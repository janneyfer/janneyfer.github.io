	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<h3>Finding the right interspace</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Position the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Have patient roll into the fetal position with his knees bent and tucked into his chest and head flexed down towards his chest. </li>
			<li>The lumbar puncture can be performed using any of the L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 interspaces. Spinal cord ends at L1 in adults and end in the cauda equina. Do not goabove the L2-L3 space to avoid damaging the spinal cord. </li>
			<li>Palpate the posterior iliac crests. The intersection of the superior border of the posterior iliac crests and the spine marks the L4 spinous process. Palpate each interspace and choose one to identify under ultrasound. With ultrasound positioned vertically along the spine, locate the space between two spinous processes and mark the area. Rotate the ultrasound 90 degrees and again visualize your interspace and mark the area.</li>
		</ol>
	<h3>Preparing your supplies and the patient</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Clean the patient with chloroprep twice</li>
			<li>Open up your lumbar puncture kit</li>
			<li>Gown up and put on sterile gloves</li>
			<li>Clean the patient with chloroprep again</li>
			<li>Set up your lumbar puncture kit. Loosen the caps on all four CSF tubes and stand them upright. Draw up 5cc of lidocaine from the kit using a filter needle. </li>
			<li>Drape the patient. Tuck the lumbar kit white paper towel under the patient. Place blue towels on the left, right, and on top of the interspace. Finally drape him with the sheet from the lumbar kit aiming the hole at your desired interspace</li>
			<li>Make a wheal with lidocaine on the skin. Go in w/ the lidocaine needle and continue to give lidocaine. </li>
			<li>Palpate for your space, and insert the LP needle in a slight angle directed towards the umbilicus. Remember to direct the needle tip parallel to the longitudinal dural fibers to prevent cutting the cord fibers. 
				<ul>
					<li>The needle should go in slowly and smoothly. A characteristic pop is felt when the needle penetrates the dura. Remove the stylet and observe for fluid return. </li>
					<li>If the needle does not enter smoothly and you hit bone, then walk down the bone until you find the interspace </li>
					<li>If the needle goes in smoothly, but there is no fluid observed after withdrawing the stylet, replace the stylet. Attempt to advance or withdraw the needle a frew millimeters and recheck for fluid. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>To check for opening pressure attach the manometer through the stop cock and wait for the fluid to normalize in the fluid column. The height is the opening pressure. </li>
			<li>Collect at least 1ml, ideally 3ml in each of the 4 plasic tubes. The clearest tube (usually tube 3) is sent for cell count and differential. </li>
			<li>Replace the stylet and remove the needle. Apply a sterile dressing.</li>
